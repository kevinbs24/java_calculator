# Java Calculator Project

This repository documents my progression from a simple console-based Java calculator
to a GUI-based Swing calculator with structured operator handling.

## Versions

### v0.1 – Console Calculator
- Text-based user input using Scanner
- Supports add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Uses loops and switch statements
- Focuses on control flow and input validation

### v0.2 – Swing GUI Calculator (In Progress)
- Built with Java Swing
- Button-based input
- Separated UI, input handling, and operator logic
- Preparing for order-of-operations (PEMDAS)

## Goals
- Demonstrate incremental software development
- Practice refactoring and architectural improvements
- Learn proper Git version control workflows
- Prepare for more complex projects (Task Manager, 2D Java Game)

## Planned Improvements
- Order of operations (PEMDAS)
- Decimal input support
- Keyboard input
- Improved UI layout
- Error handling
